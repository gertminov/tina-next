            The hosting service for our digital assets provides us with the
            online platform through which we can offer our services to you. Your
            data may be stored via our hosting provider&apos;s data storage,
            databases and general applications. It stores your data on secure
            servers behind a firewall and it provides secure HTTPS access to
            most areas of its services. <br /> Notwithstanding the measures and
            efforts taken by us and our hosting provider, we cannot and do not
            guarantee absolute protection and security of the data you upload,
            post or otherwise share with us or others. For this reason, we ask
            that you establish strong passwords and, where possible, do not
            provide us or others with confidential information that you believe
            could cause you significant or lasting harm if disclosed. In
            addition, because email and instant messaging are not considered
            secure forms of communication, we ask that you do not share
            confidential information through either of these communication
            channels.

        <Section title={"How we deal with minors"}>
          <p>
            Children can use our services. However, if they wish to access
            certain features, they may be required to provide certain
            information. The collection of some data (including data collected
            via cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies) may be
            automatic. If we knowingly collect, use or disclose information
            collected from a child, we will indicate this in accordance with
            applicable law and obtain parental consent. We do not condition a
            child's participation in an online activity on the child providing
            more contact information than is reasonably necessary to participate
            in that activity. We will only use the information we collect in
            connection with the services the child has requested. We may also
            use a parent's contact information to communicate about the child's
            activities in the Services. Parents may review data we have
            collected from their child, prohibit us from collecting further data
            from their child, and request that any data we have collected be
            deleted from our records. Please contact us to view, update or
            delete your child's information. For your child's protection, we may
            ask you to provide proof of your identity. We may deny you access to
            the data if we believe your identity is questionable. Please note
            that certain data cannot be deleted due to other legal obligations.
            If you are located in the EEA, your personal data will only be
            transferred to locations outside the EEA if we are satisfied that
            there is an adequate or comparable level of protection for personal
            data. We will take appropriate steps to ensure that we have adequate
            contractual arrangements in place with our third parties to ensure
            that appropriate safeguards are in place so that the risk of
            unlawful use, alteration, deletion, loss or theft of your personal
            data is minimised and that such third parties act at all times in
            accordance with applicable laws.

            to time, but the version posted on the Site will always be current
            (see the &quot;Status&quot; statement). We encourage you to review

            material changes, we will post a notice to that effect on our
            website. Your continued use of the Services after we have posted
            notice of changes on our website will constitute your
            acknowledgement and acceptance of the changes to the Privacy Policy
            and your agreement to be bound by the terms of those changes.
